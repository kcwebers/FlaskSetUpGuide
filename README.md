# Flask SetUp Guide

### Step 1 - Creating a new project

Navigate to the parent folder where you would like to save your project. Navigate into that folder and create a new folder / new directory. To navigate through folders using your CLI (command line interface such as Command Line, Commander, Terminal, etc.), use the ` cd ` command. You also can copy the path of the folder you want to navigate into and paste it into your CLI to move directly into the parent folder.

Once in your desired parent directory, you can create your project folder directly in your CLI with the ` mkdir ` command followed by a space and the desired name of your project.

![mkdir](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/mkdir.png "mkdir")

Once your project folder has been created, navigate into that folder using the ` cd ` command followed by the name of the project.

### Step 2 - Creating a virtual environment in your project

Inside of the project folder, in this case the project name is ` sample_project ` we need to do our installs for our virtual environment! You can make sure ` pipenv ` is properly installed on your machine. 
_**If you have installed it ONCE, you do not neet to install it again. ` pip ` installs to your machine, so once it's there it's there!**_

Windows
```text
pip install pipenv
```

iOS
```text
pip3 install pipenv
```

Once you have ` pipenv ` available, you can call on it to install for your virtual environment. 
_**The following commands need to happen for EVERY PROJECT you create!**_

Windows & iOS
```text
pipenv install flask
```

For some people, this command will not work so you can run the alternative command as follows.

Windows
```text
python -m pipenv install flask
```

iOS
```text
python3 -m pipenv install flask
```

After completing the installation of Flask, a ` Pipfile ` and ` Pipfile.lock ` should appear in your project folder.

![pipfiles](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/pipfile.png "pipfiles")

Lastly, to activate your virtual environment, run the command ` pipenv shell `! Your environment will be activated and you should see some indicator at the start of the line in your CLI that has your project name in paranthese [may vary based on CLI].
_**If you had to use the alternative command for the installation of flask, you will need that same start of the command here**_

![installing and activating virtual environment](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/venv.png "installing and activating virtual environment")

To deactivate your virtual environment, run the command ` exit `. 
_**You should ` exit ` your virtual environment when you move onto a new project. Every environment should be unique to the project you are currently working on!**_

### Step 3 - Creating a server.py and templates folder

After you have properly installed everything needed and activated your virtual environment, you can open your project in your code editor. If you have the setting correct, you can open the project directly from your CLI using the command ` code . ` while in the project folder.

In your code editor, create the file ` server.py ` and the folder ` templates ` directly in the project folder [they should appear alongside eachother, next to the Pipfile and the Pipfile.lock].

![server and templates folder](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/server_templates.png "server and templates folder")

_**Important note: The folder that will hold your HTML files must be called ` templates ` otherwise you will get an error!**_

Next up, add this code to your ` server.py ` as a default:

```PY
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, session, request
# Flask - this pulls in the framework for our project
# render_template - this method allows us to hanle rendering actual files instead of just Http Response
#                   this is required if you want to render you HTML pages
# redirect - allows us to redirect to a URL that we have built out in our project
# session - a type of data storage that permeates throughout program
#           session doesn't contain anything until you tell it to store that information!
# request - allows us to 'request' information like when we pull information in from our form on the front end
app = Flask(__name__)
# creates an instance utilizing the Flask framework and store it as 'app'



@app.route('/')
# this is the decorator or annotation for the following code chunk (the following method). 
# Every route/URL in you project should have a annotation like this
# translates to: at the route of "/" in our app, we will run the following method
def index():
# function names are relatively arbirary, but cannot be used more than once!
    return render_template('index.html')
    # every route method should return something, in this case we are rendering the given template






# the following 2 lines are what allow your server to run! 
# these lines must ALWAYS be the last thing in your server file(s)
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Reminder that the first 2 lines _must_ occur first and the last 2 lines _must_ occur last.

Create a default HTML page to match the route that you have added to your ` server.py `. In this case we called it ` index.html `. Add ` index.html ` tot he previously created ` templates ` folder. You can use the code below as a simple HTML template that already includes the link for Bootstrap!

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Index Default</title>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">

</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">

        <h1>Default HTML Page!</h1>


    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure you update the ` <title> ` tag for your project!

### Step 4 - Run your server!

To run your server, bring your CLI back up. If you have left it as is, your virtual environment should still be active. In the event that you closed out of it, navigate back to you project folder and activate your enviroment.

_**To reactivate a virtual environment, you DO NOT need to reinstall anything. You only need to call the shell command!**_

```text
pipenv shell
```

In you CLI, with the environment active (check for the parentheses at the end of the line with the project name!), run the following command with the appropriate python extension (`python`, `python3`, or `py`)

```text
python server.py
```
You should see some good feedback, with one warning message that you can ignore.

![running server](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/serverrun.png "running server")

And for the grand finale! Navigate to ` http://localhost:5000/ ` to see whatever default message you have in your ` index.html `!

![check index.html file at local host](https://github.com/kcwebers/FlaskSetUpGuide/blob/main/screencaps/check.png "check index.html file at local host")

And voila! You now have a working basic Flask project to build off of!

To stop your server at anytime, in you CLI type the command ` ctrl + c `.

Happy Coding!
